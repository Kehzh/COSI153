# COSI153
## This is Bill's app for COSI153
  My app is a platform that people who lost their pet can publish information on my app, so more people can be noticed. 
 Also there is a dog's encyclopedia that allows users to loop up different breeds of dogs, and the encyclopedia will return some basic information about the dog. For example, the breed group, the origin country, the temperaments...
 
**What I want to add:**
I tried to let my app connect to the MongoDB so that i can add authentication, let each user only able to edit their own poster. However, the Realm sdk that MongoDB useing for mobile app can only be tested on ios or android simulator and expo does not support Realm. I have tried to download one, but ios simulator only works on mac(I am using is a windows), android simulator cannot recognize the java on my laptop for unkown reason.......XD
